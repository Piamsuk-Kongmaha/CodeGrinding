# Coding Grind - My Journey Through Contests

Welcome to the **Coding Grind** repository! This space is a testament to my journey through the world of coding challenges, competitive programming, and relentless self-improvement. It's a record of my progress, my wins, my losses, and all the hard work I've put into sharpening my skills. If you're someone who’s just starting out in the world of competitive programming or a seasoned coder, this repository is for you.

## The Beginning: Where It All Started

My journey into coding was anything but ordinary. It began as a curiosity, a desire to solve problems and understand how things worked beneath the surface. I wanted to challenge myself, and I stumbled upon coding contests—places where the best programmers from around the world tested their skills. Little did I know that this would become more than just a hobby. It would shape my mindset, my approach to problem-solving, and even the way I saw life.

The first contest I entered felt intimidating. I was new, inexperienced, and the problems seemed daunting. But I didn’t let that stop me. I decided to dive deep and commit myself to improvement, no matter how long it would take or how many mistakes I’d make. Every contest became a stepping stone toward a better version of myself, and each failure brought me closer to the success I was aiming for.

## Why This Repository?

This repository isn’t just a collection of files. It’s a chronicle of my evolution as a coder. It's where I’ve stored all the solutions I’ve written during my time participating in contests. From beginner-level problems to complex algorithmic challenges, this repository reflects my hard work, dedication, and growth.

Here, you'll find:

- **Code from all the contests I’ve participated in**: Each folder and file contains the problems I’ve solved or attempted, along with the solutions I came up with (or learned from after the fact).
- **Solutions to practice problems**: Sometimes I’ll solve random problems for fun or practice a specific technique. Those solutions are also here.
- **Reflection on my journey**: I’ll occasionally add notes on my thought process during a contest, what worked, what didn’t, and how I could improve.
- **Mentorship and learning**: This repository isn’t just about me. It’s also about sharing what I’ve learned so others can follow the same path. If you're new to competitive programming or coding in general, you’ll find helpful insights and links to resources that helped me along the way.

### Why I Keep Pushing

The grind never stops. It’s easy to fall into a comfort zone, but one thing I've learned is that the real growth comes from pushing yourself past the limits of your knowledge. Every contest, every challenge, is an opportunity to learn, even if you fail. Failure isn’t the end; it’s just the beginning of the next phase in the learning cycle.

I don’t compete in coding contests just to win—I do it to improve. Winning is a bonus, but what really matters is the journey. Every contest I enter, I push my limits. I aim to solve problems faster, think more creatively, and refine my algorithms. I’ve faced some really tough problems, and I’ve often been overwhelmed. But I’ve also felt the exhilaration of solving problems that once seemed impossible.

There were moments when I wanted to quit. There were times I thought I wasn't cut out for this. But those feelings only made me stronger. The journey has been hard, but it has also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

## The Road to Improvement

Competitive programming isn’t just about knowing algorithms and data structures; it's about building a mindset of perseverance, creativity, and logical thinking. When I first started out, I had no idea about topics like dynamic programming, graph theory, or advanced data structures. But little by little, I chipped away at these concepts, taking on more complex problems as my understanding deepened.

Every single contest pushed me to learn something new. Some problems were solvable with algorithms I knew well; others forced me to learn something entirely new. Over time, I became more efficient. The nervousness I once felt at the start of each contest was replaced by the thrill of tackling challenges head-on. I could feel myself growing as a problem solver.

## The Power of Consistency

One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned on this journey is the power of consistency. Success doesn’t come from the occasional big win; it comes from the steady, everyday grind. Solving problems regularly, participating in contests, and learning new techniques have all been part of this consistent effort. 

When I look back at my progress, it’s clear that the small wins add up. The more I practiced, the better I got. And even when things didn’t go well, the key was to keep going. I would review my mistakes, learn from them, and return to the next challenge stronger and more focused.

## The Contests

The contests I’ve participated in are varied—some were online challenges, while others were hosted by universities and coding platforms. Each of these contests brought its own set of challenges, but I embraced them all. Every contest was a learning experience that added value to my coding repertoire.

Here’s a brief list of contests that stand out to me:

- **Junior Dev Contest**: The Junior Dev Contest was an early milestone in my coding journey. It helped me understand the foundational principles of competitive programming and set the stage for more advanced challenges. The problems tested not only my algorithmic knowledge but also my ability to handle challenges in a limited amount of time. It was an incredible starting point for me, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made since.

- **Codeforces Rounds**: Codeforces has always been a favorite of mine due to the variety of problems it offers and its highly competitive nature. The fast-paced rounds forced me to think quickly and efficiently. I’ve learned to tackle problems with greater confidence and speed as I participated in more and more rounds.

- **AtCoder**: Known for its high-quality problems, AtCoder has been a platform that pushed me to deepen my understanding of advanced algorithms. From its Beginner Contests to more challenging Grand Contests, AtCoder has provided me with a continuous opportunity to improve my problem-solving skills and learn new techniques.

- **CodeChef**: CodeChef has been a key platform in my competitive programming journey, with its extensive collection of problems and regular contests. Whether it's the long challenge or the short contests, CodeChef has pushed me to think creatively and refine my algorithmic skills.

## My Motivation

At the core of this journey is my drive for self-improvement. I believe in pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. The thrill of solving difficult problems and the satisfaction of seeing progress over time are the things that motivate me. I also take great inspiration from others in the competitive programming community—seeing their successes and learning from their experiences.

To anyone reading this, I encourage you to keep going. No matter where you are in your journey, don’t give up. Whether you’ve just started or have been grinding for years, the progress you make will build up, one small step at a time. Keep coding, keep solving problems, and embrace the grind.

## How You Can Contribute

If you’re passionate about coding and want to contribute to this repository, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. If you’ve solved any problems I’ve worked on or if you have suggestions for resources and challenges, I would love to collaborate with you.

Also, if you’re new to competitive programming and need help or guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I’ve been there, and I’m always happy to share my experiences and help others navigate this exciting field.

## Final Thoughts

This repository is a reflection of my journey, my growth, and my commitment to becoming a better problem solver. It’s not just about the code—it’s about the learning, the persistence, and the mindset that I’ve developed over time. I look back at where I started and see how far I’ve come, and that’s what keeps me moving forward.

# The grind is tough, but it’s worth it.
